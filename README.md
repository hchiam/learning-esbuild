# Learning [`esbuild`](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild)

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

<https://github.com/evanw/esbuild>

Faster than [parcel](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-parcel), [webpack](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-webpack), and rollup? Without cache?

<https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started>

## From scratch

Using [`yarn`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn):

```bash
yarn add
```

Or with `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

And then:

```bash

```

## Starting by testing out this repo <!-- Replace "template"s and "# and then ..."s in this section -->

Using [`yarn`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn): (triple-click to select all)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-template.git && cd learning-template && yarn; # and then ...
```

Or with `npm`: (triple-click to select all)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-template.git && cd learning-template && npm install; # and then ...
```
